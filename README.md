## 🔧 About Me

I'm a passionate engineer who works close to the metal — building robust, low-level embedded systems that connect hardware to the cloud. My expertise lies in designing and developing firmware for microcontrollers, networking protocols, EV chargers, and smart IoT devices.

- 🔌 Currently working on **EVSE with OCPP (Open Charge Point Protocol)**
- 🧠 Experienced with **microcontrollers** like **ESP32**, **STM32**, **Arduino**, **Dialog (Renesas DA series)** and **Microchip SAM series**
- 📡 Love diving into **protocols** like UART, SPI, I2C, PPPoS, WebSockets
- 🌱 Learning about **system automation**, **firmware CI/CD**, and **product scalability**
